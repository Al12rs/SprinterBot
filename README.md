# SprinterBot
This is a Reinforcement Learning Bot for Rocket League trained with the goal of reaching the ball at the center of the field as fast as possible, in the hope of learning to performa a half-flip and a speed flip in the process.
The experiment was a success with v2 of the bot able to perform both the half-flip and speed flip. 

Final Result:
![SprinterBot 470M half-flip 640p](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26797547/188917992-003c62dd-6ebc-4045-bcf8-5254fc05edf0.gif)
